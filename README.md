# SnakeGame
C Language


We have to build a snake game without seeing the codes that are already available on the internet. 
To do that easily, I propose that it is better to build the game in versions instead of trying to build it all at once. Following are the versions that I think we should make:

1. Create a simple code that can control the movement of a single character, say "*" (which represents the body of the snake), using wasd keys i.e. on pressing 'd', star should move one step right,
          on pressing 's' , it should move one step down,
          on pressing 'w' , it should move one step up,
          on pressing 'a' , it should move one step left.
   
   To create the code for this step, I had to again think about it in steps  or 'sub-steps' we can say
   
   So, among the files that are uploaded on git hub,     1.0.0.1.c, 1.0.1.0.c, 1.0.1.1.c, contains the code of this step.
   1.0.1.1.c contains the complete code of this step.    1.0.0.1.c, 1.0.1.0.c tells what steps I took to make 1.0.1.1.c
   
  
2. I am currently on this version. Create a code in which the "*" (which represents the body of the snake) moves:
        right continuously on pressing 'd',
        down continuously on pressing 's',
        up continuously on pressing 'w',
        left continuously on pressing 'a',
        just like a snake that moves in level 1 (the snake is of size 1) of a typical snake game.
        
3. Creating the food for the snake.
4. The snake should elongate on eating the food.
5. Further versions of the game will include proper functionality including the snake dying if it touches either itself or the wall.

Happy Developing :)
